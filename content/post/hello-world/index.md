## Introduction

[Mario Simoni](https://www.polito.it/en/staff?p=mario.simoni) is a PhD student at the [Department of Electronics and Communications](https://www.det.polito.it/en) of [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/en).

His main research activities focus on emerging **quantum hardware** for **quantum computing** and **quantum communication**, from primary physical principles to design and optimisation strategies.  He is particularly interested in the analysis and modelling of promising technologies, such as **solid-state qubits**, that have the potential to enhance current quantum information processing infrastructures. 

In his free time, Mario loves travelling, reading poetry, taking pictures, visiting art galleries and listening to classical music.
