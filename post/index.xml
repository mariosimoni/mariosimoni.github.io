His main research activities focus on emerging quantum hardware for quantum computing and quantum communication, from primary physical principles to design and optimisation strategies. He is particularly interested in the analysis and modelling of promising technologies, such as solid-state qubits, that have the potential to enhance current quantum information processing infrastructures.
In his free time, Mario loves travelling, reading poetry, taking pictures, visiting art galleries and listening to classical music.</description></item></channel></rss>
